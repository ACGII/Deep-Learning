# Deep-Learning
A Sampling of Deep Learning Projects developed while taking the course

1.  Optimization Methods - Optimization of the Cost Function for Gradient Descent. Implemented using Python, NUMPY and Jupyter/Graphlab

2.  Residual Networks - (ResNets) - Implements the basic building blocks of ResNets.  Puts together these building blocks 
to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.  The assignment is implemented in Keras.
